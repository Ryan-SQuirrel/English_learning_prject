I was playing ~~at~~ in my ~~cousin~~ cousin's house.   
Since his family was rich than mine, he had more toys than I did.  
There was one on particular I’d always wanted.  
I put **it** into my pocket when he wasn’t looking.  
I ~~guessed~~ guess, even at that age, I would never ~~be~~ able to enjoy to playing with the toy or ~~faced~~ facing my cousin again;  
I would always know I’d done something wrong.  
~~Late~~ Later on, my aunt drove me home.  
When she dropped me off, I pulled out the toy ~~slow~~ slowly and gave it back.  
She knows what ~~had~~ happened, but she ~~thanked~~ thanks me and ~~ever~~ never mentioned it again.
